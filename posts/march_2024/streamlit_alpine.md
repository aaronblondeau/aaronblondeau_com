Who wants to fight with React all day long just to make a simple custom component for Streamlit?  **Not me.**

Instead I made this template using [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/) to create custom a component : [https://github.com/aaronblondeau/streamlit_alpine](https://github.com/aaronblondeau/streamlit_alpine)

P.S. If you haven't played with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) yet, try it out. It is a fun and extremely capable tool.
